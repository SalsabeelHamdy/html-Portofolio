  During my time as a Technical Geophysicist at Tatweer Petroleum Company, I had the opportunity to apply my expertise in geophysical interpretation and analysis. I utilized tools such as Aspentech SSE, Paradigm & Roxar Interpretation package, Seisearth, and QSI to perform advanced data analysis and contribute to exploration and production strategies. I worked collaboratively with geophysicists and professionals to integrate geophysical data with geological, petrophysical, and production data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the subsurface.

  In terms of internships, I have gained valuable practical experience at South Valley Egyptian Petroleum Holding Company - GANOPE, the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics, and within the Geology Department of Cairo University. These opportunities provided me with exposure to different aspects of the field and allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.

  I have also undertaken projects, including my notable work on "Gold Mineralization Opportunities in West Quseir, Eastern Desert, Egypt" as part of my studies at Cairo University. This project showcased my ability to conduct independent research, analyze geological data, and provide valuable insights.

  In addition to my expertise in geophysics, I have developed proficiency in various software tools such as ICDL, Matlab (Application in Geophysics), Petral in Seismic Interpretation, Surfur, and Oasis montaj (Geosoft). Furthermore, I possess strong social media management skills, with experience in handling platforms like Facebook and Instagram.
